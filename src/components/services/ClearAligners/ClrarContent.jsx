              <b> Simple Tooth Extraction: </b>
              This category typically includes the removal of teeth that are
              visible in the mouth and do not require surgical procedures. These
              are straightforward extractions, often involving teeth that are
              fully erupted and have simple root structures.

            <p>
              <b>Intermediate Tooth Extraction: </b>
              This involves slightly more complex procedures than simple
              extractions. It might include the removal of teeth that have
              broken at the gum line or have not fully erupted, like partially
              erupted wisdom teeth. The process might require sectioning the
              tooth or removing some overlying bone.

            <p>
              <b>Complex Tooth Extraction: </b>
              Complex extractions are the most involved and typically include
              surgical procedures. This might involve the removal of impacted
              teeth, like impacted wisdom teeth, or teeth with complicated root
              structures. These extractions usually require incisions, removal
              of bone, and possibly the sectioning of the tooth into multiple
              parts for easier removal.

          Post-operative instructions after a tooth extraction
        </h1>
        <p className="p-style-2">
          Post-operative instructions after a tooth extraction are crucial for a
          smooth recovery and to minimize the risk of complications. Here's a
          general guide, but remember to follow any specific instructions given
          by your dentist or oral surgeon:
          <br />
          <br />
          <p className="p-style-2">
            <b> • Bleeding Management:</b> <br />
            - Use over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or
            acetaminophen as directed.
            <br /> - If prescribed pain medication, take as instructed.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p className="p-style-2">
            <b> • Swelling and Bruising :</b> <br />- Apply an ice pack to the
            cheek near the extraction site for 10 minutes on, then 10 minutes
            off, during the first 24 hours.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p className="p-style-2">
            <b> • Rest:</b> <br />
            - Relax for at least 24 hours after the extraction.
            <br /> - Avoid strenuous activities for 2-3 days to reduce bleeding
            and help the healing process.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p className="p-style-2">
            <b> • Oral Hygiene::</b> <br />
            - Do not rinse your mouth for the first 24 hours.
            <br /> - After 24 hours, gently rinse with warm salt water (1/2
            teaspoon of salt in a cup of water) after meals and before bed.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p className="p-style-2">
            <b> • Bleeding Management:</b> <br />- Bite on a gauze pad firmly
            for 30-60 minutes after the extraction. <br />- If bleeding
            continues, replace the gauze and bite down for another 30 minutes.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p className="p-style-2">
            <b> • Eating and Drinking:</b> <br />
            - Start with soft foods and liquids
            <br /> - Avoid using a straw for the first few days to prevent
            dislodging the blood clot. <br />- Avoid hot liquids and alcoholic
            beverages in the first 24 hours.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p className="p-style-2">
            <b> • Smoking:</b> <br />- Avoid smoking for as long as possible
            after the extraction, ideally for at least 48 hours.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p className="p-style-2">
            <b> • Protect the Clot:</b> <br />
            - Avoid spitting or rinsing forcefully.
            <br /> - Chew on the opposite side of your mouth.s.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p className="p-style-2">
            <b> • Medications:</b> <br />- Take any prescribed antibiotics as
            directed to prevent infection.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p className="p-style-2">
            <b> • Follow-Up:</b> <br />- Keep any follow-up appointments with
            your dentist or oral surgeon.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p className="p-style-2">
            <b> • Watch for Complications:</b> <br />- Look out for signs of
            infection like fever, severe pain, or swelling that worsens after a
            few days. Also, be aware of dry socket, a condition where the blood
            clot fails to develop or is dislodged, leading to delayed healing.{" "}
