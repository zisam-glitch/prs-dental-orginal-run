              <p className="text-xl my-8">
                At Parish Dental, we strive to provide timely and quality dental
                care to all our patients. We understand that your time is
                valuable, and so is ours. Unattended appointments and short
                notice cancellations disrupt the practice's ability to serve
                other patients in need. Therefore, we have implemented the
                following Failed Appointments and Short Notice Cancellations
                Policy.

                <li className="my-4">
                  <b>Notification Requirement:</b> We require a minimum of 2
                  working days' notice if you need to cancel or reschedule an
                  appointment. This allows us to offer the time slot to other
                  patients who may be in urgent need of care.

                  <b>Short Notice Cancellation:</b> If an appointment is
                  cancelled with less than 2 working days' notice, the following
                  will apply:
                  <ul className="list-disk p-6 text-xl">

                      patient cancels at short notice 4 times within a 2-year
                      period, we reserve the right to deny any further NHS

                  informed of developments – by telephone, letters or e-mail or

                  how the complaint will be handled and the likely time that the
                  investigation will take to complete. If the individual does

              In this practice, we take complaints seriously to ensure that our
              service meets expectations. All complaints are dealt with
              courteously and promptly to resolved the matter as quickly as
              possible.

            <p className="text-xl mt-8">
              Our aim is to react to complaints and learn from every mistake
              that we make. We respond to any concerns in a caring and sensitive
              way.

                  The person responsible for dealing with any complaints about
                  the service that we provide is the Manager, our Complaints’
                  Manager.

                  If we receive a complaint by telephone or in person, we will
                  listen and offer to refer the individual to the Complaints’
                  Manager immediately. If the Complaints’ Manager is not
                  available at the time, we arrange a convenient time for the
                  Complaints’ Manager to contact the individual. The member of
                  staff will take brief details of the issue and pass it to the
                  Complaints’ Manager and provide the individual with a copy. If
                  the matter requires a more immediate response, we will arrange
                  for a senior member of the dental team to deal with it.

                  If a complaint is about any aspect of clinical care or
                  associated charges, it will usually be referred to the dentist
                  concerned, unless the individual does not want this to happen.

                  We will acknowledge a complaint in writing and enclose a copy
                  of this code of practice as soon as possible, normally within
                  3 working days. We will offer to discuss the complaint with
                  the individual, and confirm how they would like to be kept
                  informed of developments – by telephone, letters or e-mail or
                  by face-to-face meetings. We will inform the individual about
                  how the complaint will be handled and the likely time that the
                  investigation will take to complete. If the individual does
                  not wish to discuss the complaint further, we will still
                  inform them of the expected timescale for completing the
                  investigation.

                  individual with a full written report, which will include an
                  explanation of how we considered the complaint, the
                  conclusions reached in respect of each specific part of the
